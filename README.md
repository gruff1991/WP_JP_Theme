# WP_JP_Theme
wordpress theme for my website.

This theme is a two piece for me as it allows me to expand my github and portfolio as well as set up my project. WP_JP_Theme is going to be the basic theme template that will add minimum need functionality to have a working jobs board.

all other functionality should be added via plugins to enable X theme compatability.
